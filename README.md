<summary>Scenario</summary>

A regional environmental agency has tasked you with developing a cross-platform application to enhance their monitoring of local environmental conditions. The agency is focused on monitoring air quality, water quality, and weather conditions to ensure public safety and adherence to environmental regulations.
<br><br>
The agency utilises a widespread network of sensors that collect data on air pollutants, water pH levels, and meteorological data. This data is vital for the agency to make informed decisions and effectively address environmental issues.

<summary>Types of Environmental Data</summary>

There are three categories of environmental data to be monitored:
1. **Air Quality**: Requires real-time monitoring and analysis to identify trends or sudden changes.
2. **Water Quality**: Continuous updates and detailed reports on chemical and biological content are necessary.
3. **Weather Conditions**: Live tracking and forecasting are essential to anticipate and respond to environmental changes.

<summary>User Stories</summary>

An initial requirements elicitation session has identified the following user stories that the application should include:

As an **Environmental Scientist**, I want to
- Manage sensor accounts and configure settings.
- View and analyse historical environmental data.
- Receive real-time alerts on threshold breaches, displayed on an interactive map.
- Generate comprehensive reports on environmental trends.
- Use a map to view real-time sensor statuses and alerts geographically.
- Locate and navigate to sensors in the field for maintenance or inspection purposes.

As an **Operations Manager** I want to
- Monitor the operational status of sensors.
- Schedule maintenance and ensure timely checks.
- Verify the accuracy and integrity of collected data.
- Address and report sensor malfunctions or anomalies.

As an **Administrator** I want to
- Manage user access and roles within the application.
- Maintain high levels of system security and data protection.
- Update sensor configurations and firmware.
- Oversee data storage and implement backup strategies.
