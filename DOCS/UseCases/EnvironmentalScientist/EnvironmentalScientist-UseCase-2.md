# USE CASE 2:
### View and Analyse Historical Environmental Data.  

### Goal in Context:
As an Environmental Scientist, I want to view and analyse historical environmental data to identify trends, patterns, and unusual behaviours in environmental conditions.

### Scope and Level:
The functionality of the application that allows the Environmental Scientist to access and analyse historical environmental data collected from available sensors.

### Preconditions:
- The database stores historical environmental data, including information such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and other relevant metrics.
- The system provides data visualisation and analytical tools.

### Success End Condition:
- The Environmental Scientist can successfully retrieve and analyse historical environmental data to support research purposes.

### Failed End Condition:
- The historical environmental data is not available or inaccurate.
- The Environmental Scientist cannot access or interpret the data.

### Primary Actor:
Environmental Scientist.

### Trigger:
Pressing a button in the dashboard called "Historical Data".

### Main Success Scenario:
1. The Environmental Scientist navigates to the dashboard and clicks on "Historical Data".
2. The system retrieves historical environmental data from the database.
3. The system displays the data in table view or graphical formats for easier reading.
4. The Environmental Scientist identifies trends, patterns, or unusual behaviours.

### Extensions:
3a. The system fails to retrieve historical environmental data.
   - The system displays an error message.
   - The Environmental Scientist retries the action or contacts support.

4a. The dataset is too large to process instantly.
   - The system prompts the user to refine the filters or schedule a report for later retrieval.

### Sub-variations:
1. The Environmental Scientist downloads raw data for external analysis.
2. The Environmental Scientist compares multiple environmental metrics over time.

### Schedule:
TBA
